HEADER BANNER

Welcome to our project thread. Lumbridge is a remake based around September of 2008. We feel that this is when Runescape was extremely fun to play: it didn't have any trade limits but still had the grand exchange and skills such as construction. This server has been worked on for a little over 4 years and we're finally ready to put up a project thread so that people can start finding out about us.


SKILLS BANNER

All our skills have been coded meticulously in order to reach absolute perfection. We have currently got all the skills working perfectly and full aside from Hunter and Construction. Hunter is about 90% done, and construction is also about 90% done. We're very sure these will be fully completed before we release the beta. All combat skills are working perfectly too, so PKing works very well on Lumbridge. 

"MADE BY YOU!" BANNER
At Lumbridge, we want the community to help us. Obviously replicating the entire 2008 era of runescape is no easy task, and definitely not one for one person over 4 years. Whilst we've got the vitals down such as minigames, skills and bosses - there are other things we'd like to have added from 2008. These are often quite small things which will just help with the nostalgic element of the game. Because of this, we've released a public API that our community can use to code plugins in Java for the server. Our developer will then review them and convert them to Fantom code, before adding them into the server itself. You can earn yourself 3 different tiers of ranks from this: Plugin Developer I, Plugin Developer II and Official Plugin Developer. This is a great way for people who want to improve their programming to do so without worrying about breaking the entire server. Anyone reaching the rank of Official Plugin Developer will be paid a monthly fee for their work. As well as this we're likely to host monthly competitions where we will pay for the best plugin created.

MINIGAMES & BOSSES BANNER
We've got a lot of the fun minigames currently in the server, and are working towards adding the rest.

OSRS CONTENT BANNER
Whilst we pride ourselves on being a remake, one of the things we noticed is the lack of bosses that 2008 Runescape had. Because of this, we've decided to add some of the player-favourite bosses from OSRS. We'll also add their drops and intend to add Rooftop Agility too, simply because it's fun to do. We do still class ourselves as a remake however, we just think it's important that there is plenty of fun things for players to do.
