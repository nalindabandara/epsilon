Contact einsteinK (PM or in-game on ROBLOX, IRC, Discord servers I'm on, ...) to get your group's tags added.
You can also just drop it into your group's description.
This pastebin is just so you don't have to "ruin" your description.

My advice: Give me a pastebin/asset/inherit-tag, so you can edit it remotely.
(I'm not gonna like it if you ask me to change it every few days)
(I'll still change it, but it might take several hours if I'm offline)
